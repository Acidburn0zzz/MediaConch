## Reporter - Command Line Interface

### Functional Overview

In the context of the Command Line Interface the Reporter presents human and machine-readable reports to the end user, including individual metadata readouts, policy checking, conformance checking, and metadata fixing documentation. This data is derived from the PreForma core and transformed into a desired output. 

###Design and Functional Requirements

On the command line interface, a user would be able to export a report using flags designating output (eg., "-o") and output format (eg., "-of").
