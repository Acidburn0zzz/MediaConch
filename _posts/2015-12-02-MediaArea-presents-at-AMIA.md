# MediaArea presents at AMIA

Representing MediaConch were Ashley Blewer and Dave Rice, and representing PREFORMA was Erwin Verbruggen of Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid / Sound and Vision. The group spoke on Friday afternoon on "Validate Your Digital Assets: PREFORMA, MediaConch and File Compliance." 

Erwin introduced the PREFORMA project, his institutions involvement with it, and its role as a European Commission FP7-ICT Programme project. 



Dave went into the details of the EBML (the language Matroska is based on), Matroska and FFv1 formats and explained the importance and benefits of these formats at the technical level. What technical details make these specifications better for archivists to use over others?

Ashley gave semi-live demonstrations (by narrating over gifs) of how the software works based on MediaConch's [online do-it-yourself demo](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch/demo.html). She demostrated both versions on the command line and via the graphical user interface (available as a downloadable GUI or via web platform) and showed what a conformance report exported into xml and html looks like.

During the Q&A, Dave emphasized the importance of Matroska as a wrapper because it's a well-supported, open source format as opposed to a wrapper such as AVI, which is a proprietary wrapper owned by Microsoft and on the verge of becoming obsolete.

Dave Rice also gave a talk at the opening plenery on the future of the Association of Moving Image Archivist and the field at large. A transcript of his talk can be read [here](http://dericed.com/2015/amia15-the-next-25/). He made sure to mention the breaking news of the announcement of CELLAR, an IETF working group that will focus on the standardization of FFV1, Matroska, and FLAC formats.

As usual, mediainfo gets a lot of hype in the audiovisual archivist community. From [posters](https://twitter.com/EddyColloton/status/667455277562621953) to [presentations](/MediaConch/images/gb_mi.png). Even a [lack of MediaInfo](/MediaConch/images/no_mi.png) in a hack day project was notable because it's such an integral part of video preservation (they used ffprobe only). We hope that by next year, AMIA members will have begun integrating MediaConch and MediaTrace into their archiving workflows just as they have with MediaInfo.
