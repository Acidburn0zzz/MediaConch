# Style Guide

Files related to documentation should be named in CamelCase. Sample data should be added in snake_case with a sufficiently descriptive title.

Commit messages should concisely summarize the contribution. Commits should be cohesive and only include changes to relevant files (e.g. do not fix a typo in the Style Guide, change scope paramaters, and fix a bug all in the same commit).

For Qt/C++ code:

4 spaces are used for indentation. Tabs are never used.

For more guidelines, refer to the Qt Coding Style guide: http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_Coding_Style
For even more guidelines, Google guide on C++: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html
