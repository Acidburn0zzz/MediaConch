###Questionnaire Concluding Report

Over the course of one week in February 2015 (2/15-2/22), thirty participants completed a web-based questionnaire developed by Conch containing questions related to digital preservation praxis. Approximately three-quarters of these survey participants identified as working at either a library or an archive, with the remainder working at museums, broadcast, media and enterainment, post-production, or other institutions. 

Responses to the questionnaire produced the following conclusions:

-While ninety percent of participants' institutions maintained a digital repository for collection materials, only half of these institutions implemented procedures based on the OAIS reference model. For OAIS adopters, a majority of information packages were created in-house, with outside vendors providing mostly Preservation Description Information in the form of Fixity Information (40%). 

-Approximately eighty-seven percent of participant's instituions performed in-house digital reformatting of audiovisual materials, usually by a full-time institutional employee (77%). Mac OS operating systems were typically employed for these tasks (60%). Less than half of the software used in the creation of media assets and associated information packages existed as free and open-source (FOSS).

-Files were checked for conformance individually using software tools such as MediaInfo (63%). When adding additional metadata, several standards were referenced, with PREMIS (33%) and PBCore (30%) being the most popular. 

-Open codecs and wrappers were implemented the most by institutions in the creation of preservation master assets. FFV1 and LCM were currently implemented in several institutions (13% and 17%, respectively).

-On characteristics that make an ideal file format for preservation, participants chose the following traits: 1) Interoperability (27/30); 2) Low cost of implementation (22/30); 3) Transparency (21/30); 4) Availability of tools (20/30); 5) Metadata capabilities (17/30); and, 6) Low storage cost (11/30).
