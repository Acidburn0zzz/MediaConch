This does not override the element size indicated at the beginning of an element. Elements that have an indicated size which is larger than what is allowed by EBMLMaxSizeLength shall be considered invalid.,The maximum width of the size descriptors used in this document.

CRC-32,CRC32,1+,[BF],-,-,-,-,binary,"The CRC is computed on all the data from the last CRC element (or start of the upper level element), up to the CRC element, including other previous CRC elements. All level 1 elements should include a CRC-32.",The CRC32 container can be placed around any EBML element or elements. The value stored in CRC32Value is the result of the CRC-32 [CRC32] checksum performed on the other child elements.,CRC32 := c3 container [ level:1..; card:*; ] { %children; CRC32Value := 42fe binary [ size:4; ]  }
Void,Void,1+,[EC],-,-,-,-,binary,"Used to void damaged data, to avoid unexpected behaviors when using damaged data. The content is discarded. Also used to reserve space in a sub-element for later use.","The void element can be used as padding to prepare for more data, or to fill space when data has been removed. It should simply be ignored when the document is interpreted.",Void  := ec binary [ level:1..; card:*; ]
