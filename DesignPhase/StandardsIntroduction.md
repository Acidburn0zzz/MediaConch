Summary: MediaArea proposes that the PREFORMA project may facilitae the standardization of featured file formats that face a documentation or standardization gap. A standardization effort will result in the development of conformance checkers that are more authoritative, stable, and credible. This plan is based upon MediaArea's research drawn from past audiovisual standardization efforts, related open source communiites, and standards organization.
