## 15.06 Release Notes

This release of MediaConch CLI builds on the development of MediaInfo 0.7.74 and the previous MediaConch release. It includes a file parser, conformance checker, and XML structure export. MediaConch is intended for use on Matroska, FFV1, and/or PCM files.

#### CLI

New to this release is the ability to check files against Schematron documents for policy-based file conformance checking. Instructions and files for initially testing this phase of development are available on the [Demo page](/demo.html).

#### GUI

The MediaConch GUI also includes updates to the ability to check files against Schematron documents and initial support for policy set and policy rule creation. Schematron files can be imported and exported into MediaConch.
