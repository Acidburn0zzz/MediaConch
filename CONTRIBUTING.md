# Contribution Guide

## Rules for contributing feedback

The MediaArea project team welcomes contributions and feedback from contributing and/or interested institutions and individuals via issue tracking, various open source communication and social media channels, and other sources of public community outreach. Open source feedback and participation of all kinds and from any interested party or institution is encouraged and can be made through opening an issue on GitHub or contacting the team directly at info@mediaarea.net.

## Rules for contributing code

MediaArea welcomes and encourages open source contributions to the software throughout the development stage. To participate and further the MediaConch project as it develops, contributions and additions can be made to the code and/or documentation residing within the projectâ€™s Github repository. Contributions and commits should be directed to Github and written as a branch submitted as a pull request. Individual commits should be created for each change and alteration made to the relevant file or code. All contributions should be clear, concise, and follow the standardized, applicable coding and naming conventions within the each language's style guidelines.

- Fork the initial project to your own account
- Clone your own repository on your computer
- Check out a new branch with an explicit name corresponding to the bug corrected or feature added
- Make a changes and add commit(s)
- Update your local repository with the source repository in case features have been added while you were working
- Resolve conflicts if present
- Send the change to a branch in your repository
- On the Github website, go to your repository, change the branch to the new one created and create a new Pull Request with the changes (after reviewing to ensure no errors will be sent)
- Wait for someone approve and merge the changes

### File Naming Conventions

In regards to the required conventions for commit messages on the open source platform, all messages should be concise and clear and effectively summarize each contribution to the project. If more than one substantial change was made, users should not create one commit message to cover all feedback and changes. New individual commits should be made to cover each individual change made to the relevant file being altered. Effective commit messages, covering context of a change, will enable MediaArea to work within a speedier, more efficient review process and better alter development around this feedback.
