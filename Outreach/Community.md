### Project Advisors

MediaArea has approached several individual and institutional partners from varying types of organizations to provide expertise, testing, and feedback to the project as it develops. The intent of this aspect of our proposal is to facilitate an efficient  and responsive mechanism for feedback with specialized areas of expertise relavent to the project. This initiative also kickstarts the relationship between the project, open source development communities, and PreForma's target users. Such partners would recieve a fixed stipend amount from our proposed in exchange for participation in the projects mailing list, occasional requested meetings, and commenting on the project.
