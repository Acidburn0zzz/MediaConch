# Open Source Portal

Throughout the project, MediaArea will regularly make efforts to inform and explain openly to the public its development phase, progress, collaboration with other open source projects, curated findings and use cases. In order to both create and conduct within a sustainable and successful open source community, MediaArea's team anticipates managing an active, social and public promotion of the project through social media, blogging, demo videos, documentation, and outreach. Although these outreach efforts may use a diverse set of mechanisms and platforms, we will centralize such information within PreForma's Open Source Portal.

Within the first month of phase 2, MediaArea plans to set up an online presence coordinated through the Open Source Portal and in collaboration with fellow suppliers to provide information about project objectives, its roadmap, prioritized issues, and communication means (via an IRC channel, email lists, and social accounts). These different outreach channels will include access to software usage and feedback regarding project development and the relevant assets involved in the various software releases and updates. Community involvement and participation will be encouraged and an important key factor in MediaArea’s evaluation of the continued success of project. Facilitation of this collaborative and communicative public outreach will build throughout the project’s growth, with a fully functional and accessible community implemented at the development stage.

Utilizing best community practices and standards, communication with institutions will be executed through various social means. The usage of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel will enable community users to converse, share and communicate issues and feedback regarding the project freely in real time. These open channels can be publicly logged and archived for future development and support purposes. In addition to IRC channels, memory institutions and other interested organizations and users will readily have access to mailing lists, made available by MediaArea, covering the scope of the project. These mailing lists will further establish involvement and support from the public by creating ease in gaining access to documentation, software information and updates.  Their usage will focus on the implementation of an information flow covering both user and development aspects of the project’s evolvement. Topics such as general information and discussion, user questions and issues, software development updates, and bug reports can be easily communicated throughout the community and later be documented as essential pieces of the project’s growth. 
 
In union with an IRC channel and mailing list, outreach through social media accounts and platforms will allow MediaArea to facilitate the public sharing of information and updates of use and development through public blogging and informative demo videos. Social media outreach will enable the growth of a larger interested and potentially invested open source community while also furthering their insight and education into contributing to its continued development. These outlets will serve to redirect this traffic back to the Open Source Portal, where regular open source community standards and practices will be upheld.
 
For roadmap and issue tracking, we will be using a public GitHub account that will provide curated project summaries and a coding base that will be linked to within the Open Source Portal. This will provide an open and recognized platform for external contributors and users to engage and familiarize themselves with the project and its assets. To further the social and professional outreach around the development and design of the project, we will strongly encourage active participation here within the project as it occurs and invite memory institutions and the public to see and comment upon project work as it evolves. Making use of the Github’s wiki and responsive issue tracker features, full transparency and assistance with software, bug reports, and file conformance feedback will be available throughout all phases. Collaborative usage of the issue trackers and bug reports will also create more efficient management towards improvement and comprehension of the software. The Github account will also be used to mark regular releases of project software. In addition to a Github presence, we will actively work with package management systems to coordinate release and updates of project software and coordinate installation information through the Open Source Portal.
 
Public access to a supply of both created and solicited project resources, test media and reference files will also be made available through the Github account and linked to within the Open Source Portal. The usage and dissemination of these resources will focus on testing the features and designs of the conformance checker and help to highlight any issues that may appear within the specific formats (FFV1, LPCM, and Matroska). Relevant test files will conform to the specifications of their stream and container formats while others will purposely deviate from these specifications in order to allow the conformance checker to find errors. These issues can also highlight and form solutions for problems that may arise within a preservation and archival setting.  
By taking a proactive approach in creating a foundation for open source public outreach, MediaArea can effectively interact with memory institutions and other organizations and users in order to create deliverables and updates throughout the development stage. These methods will serve to produce a long term, sustainable open source community used to continuously educate and familiarize these users with MediaArea’s project development and any issues and updates that may arise on either the user or developement’s end. An establish open source community will be supported throughout the lifecycle of the project’s progress as both a means to communicate to the memory institutions and users as well as to gather collaborative feedback for the further development of the software.
