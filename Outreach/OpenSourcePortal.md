## Open Source Portal

Throughout the project MediaArea will regularly make efforts to inform and explain the project's development work, progress, collaboration with other open source projects, and curate key findings and use cases. MediaArea's team anticipates managing an active and public promotion of project through social media, blogging, demo videos, documentation, and outreach. Although outreach efforts may use a diverse set of mechanisms, we will centralize such information within PreForma's Open Source Portal.

Within the first month of phase 2, MediaArea plans to set up an online presence coordinated through the Open Source Portal to provide information about project objectives, the roadmap, prioritized issues, and communication means (IRC channel, email lists, social accounts). For roadmap and issue tracking we'll be using a public GitHub account though will provide curated summaries and linked within the Open Source Portal. We strongly encourage active participant within the project as is occurs and invite memory institutions and the public to see and comment upon project work as it evolves. Github will also be used to mark regular releases of project software. In addition to a Github presence we will actively work with package management systems to coordinate release and updates of project software and coordinate installation information through the Open Source Portal.
