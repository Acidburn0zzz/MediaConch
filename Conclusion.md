##Conclusion

The PreForma project challenge presents an opportunity for stakeholders of digital preservation to work together and develop meaningful solutions to file format conformance issues. MediaArea is proud to be among the several successful applicants of the initial PreForma tender, and is confident that our submitted Phase 1 proposal for the creation of a Matroska, FFV1 and LPCM conformance checking toolset will greatly enhance the project's overall scope. 

At the core of the PreForma project is the conformance checker, which, when produced, will implement meaningful file format validation for long-term digital preservation. MediaArea is focused on developing the checker and its related environment. MediaArea's previous work MediaInfo and QCTools projects have led to a refined project development with risk management strategies.

While LPCM endures as a prevalent raw audio stream, Matroska and FFV1 remain largely as outliers of digital preservation policy discussions among memory institutions. We believe that this is mostly due to misapprehensions of Matroska and FFV1. In addition to the development of a conformance checker, MediaArea presents a plan to strengthen the disclosure, transparency, and credibility of Matroska and FFV1 through standardization and adoption by relevant standards bodies. 

The Preforma MediaInfo team welcomes the opportunity to see the project through its completion.
