## Standardization of Formats

MediaArea proposes that the PREFORMA project may facilitate the standardization of featured file formats that face a documentation or standardization gap. A standardization effort will result in the development of conformance checkers that are more authoritative, stable, and credible. This plan is based upon MediaArea's research drawn from past audiovisual standardization efforts, related open source communiites, and standards organization.

The priorities here are largely focused on archival sustainability factors:

* Ensuring that complete, authoritative, open and accessible documentation is available
* Credibility
* Transparency

The goal of the PREFORMA project is to address the challenge of implementing good quality standardised file formats for preserving data content in the long term. Our objective in regards to standardization FFV1 and Matroska is to improve the sustainability factors for both formats including disclosure, credibility, and transparency while also creating a mechanism to clarify, authoritatively, the intent of the specifications. After careful research into past IETF work (in particular Daala and Opus), we are planning to prepare FFV1 and Matroska for submission to the IETF.

Following the establishment of informational standards, we would coordinate a community driven effort to contribute to the development of version 4 of Matroska and FFV1 and submission of the results through more formal and vetted IETF standardization procedures.

### Matroska

Work on Matroska is coordinated through [GitHub](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/ebml-specification) and the [Matroska.org devel mailing list](http://lists.matroska.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/matroska-devel). 

### FFV1

Work on FFV1 is coordinated through the [GitHub](https://github.com/MediaArea/FFV1) and the [ffmpeg-devel mailing list](http://ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel). 

## Community Interviews

In December 2014, MediaArea started conducting interviews with FFV1, Matroska, and LPCM stakeholders in order to collect feedback and insights from the archives community. To date, interviews have been conducted with:
