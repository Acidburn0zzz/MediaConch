# Interview Introduction

[PREFORMA](http://preforma-project.eu/) (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives) is a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) project co-funded by the European Commission under its FP7-ICT Programme. PREFORMA aims to address the challenge of implementing good quality standardised file formats for preserving data content in the long term. The main objective is to give memory institutions full control of the process of the conformity tests of files to be ingested into archives. MediaArea is one of six teams that will present their software architecture to the PREFORMA panel in March 2015. The panel will then make a further selection amongst suppliers from phase 1 (research) to proceed to phase 2 (development).

MediaArea has been tasked with researching community standards and developing standard conformance checks for FFV1 (a lossless video codec), Matroska Multimedia Container, and Linear Pulse-Code Modulated Audio (LPCM) to support efforts of long-term preservation in memory institutions.

MediaArea is reaching out to select archivists, vendors, and technologists who utilize or develop these audiovisual formats as part of the discovery work of our current design phase.
