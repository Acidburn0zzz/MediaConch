# Timeline

This timeline presents a summary of MediaArea's focus and objectives over the 22 months of our proposal for Phase 2 of the PREFORMA project. Although MediaArea anticipates operating in an agile framework that is responsive to the current pulse of the project and open to pragmatic modifications, this timeline presents a current understanding of the work to be performed by our team.

The timeline for facilitating standardization work through the IETF is presented as a broad overview. The timeline for standardization efforts is based on interviews with IETF members and participants in the Opus audio standardization process and represents our timeline goal; however there are many factors that may influence or change that timeline as it progresses.

The specific timeline of the Second Prototype section is largely dependent on and responsive to the outcome of the prior Re-Design section, community response, and feedback.
