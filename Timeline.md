# Timeline

This timeline presents a summary of MediaArea's focus and objectives over the 22 months of our proposal for Phase 2 of the PREFORMA project. Although MediaArea anticipates operating in an agile framework that is responsive to the current pulse of the project and open to pragmatic modifications, this timeline presents a current understanding of the work to be performed by our team.

The timeline for facilitating standardization work through the IETF is presented as a broad overview. The timeline for standardization efforts is based on interviews with IETF members and participants in the Opus audio standardization process and represents our timeline goal; however there are many factors that may influence or change that timeline as it progresses.
