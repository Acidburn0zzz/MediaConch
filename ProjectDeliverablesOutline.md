1. Establish a methodology objective

* Documentation of work plan (consideration to OSS only), strategy for collaborative workflow (“nightly builds”, open platform, software mgmt systems, bug trackers, forums, mailing lists, IRC, roadmaps and documentation…

* Set up organizational GitHub account, invite and folder structure, etc. through MediaArea organizational account.



2. Research into what makes a file valid

* Overview of each format (mkv, FFV1, PCM), benefits/negatives with regards to use as a preservation standard, technical and structural metadata for a/v streams within container

* Writeup of tests that need to happen in order to test integrity of file, limits as defined by technical details

* Establish profile for each a/v preservation file

* Check if file complies with standard specifications (how to do this)

* Check if file complies with the acceptance criteria of memory institutions (how to do this)

* Report back to human and software agents (how to do this)

* Performs simple fixes (how to do this, what kind of fixes can be done within technical limits)

* Plan for machine-readable report (including preservation metadata for each file checked and

allowing external software agents to furtherprocess the file) using XML

* Plan for human-readable report, “assessing the preservation status of a batch of files as a

whole, reporting to a non-expert audience whether a file is compliant with the standard

specifications, and addressing improvements in the creation/digitisation process.”

* Plan for fully automated fixes (what can be fixed within each format, ranges)

* Research into “checking for the existence of standard functionalities and

whether they are implemented in accordance with the corresponding specifications”



3. How to sustain open source long-term

* Plan for fostering open source collaboration practices
