<a href="http://preforma-project.eu/">PREFORMA</a> (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives) is a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) project co-funded by the European Commission under its FP7-ICT Programme. PREFORMA aims to address the challenge of implementing good quality standardised file formats for preserving data content in the long term. The main objective is to give memory institutions full control of the process of the conformity tests of files to be ingested into archives. <a href="//mediaarea.net/">MediaArea</a> is one of six teams that will present their software architecture to the PREFORMA panel in March 2015. The panel will then make a further selection amongst suppliers from phase 1 (research) to proceed to phase 2 (development).
</p>

<p>
MediaArea has been tasked with researching community standards and developing standard conformance checks for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFV1">FFV1</a> (a lossless video codec), <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska">Matroska</a> Multimedia Container, and Linear Pulse-Code Modulated Audio (LPCM) to support efforts of long-term preservation in memory institutions.
</p>

</p>
The MediaArea team has worked on several software tools used in preservation data conformance, including the <a href="//mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">MediaInfo</a> software, a tool to extract metadata from audio and video files, and Bay Area Video Coalition's <a href="http://www.bavc.org/qctools">QCTools</a> project, a tool that performs quality control checks and analysis on digitized analog video.
<p>

<p>
MediaInfo will be reaching out to related, interested communities for input and feedback on the standard and specifications of each file format and future of each format for a preservation-standard implementation checker software. If you work with these formats and are interested in contributing your requirements, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mediaarea.net">info@mediaarea.net</a>.
