# MediaConch Documentation

MediaArea's MediaConch strives to offer access and ease to users with a structure that operates similarly and efficiently cross-platform and functions in both an online and offline capacity within different interfaces.

## Shells

The core infrastructure of MediaConch scales to work on three different platforms, or shells: a command line interface, a graphical user interface, and a web interface. Each shell will coordinate the actions of the implementation checker, policy checker, reporter and fixer.

## Command Line Interface

A command line interface will be functional on nearly all types of operating systems and platforms, including those with very little graphical interface support. CLI use allows for integration into a batch-mode processing workflow for analyzing files at scale. This interface is more intended for technical and expert users and for non-human interaction.

## Graphical User Interface

A Graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed and provided for both expert and non-expert users. The GUI, being based on Qt, has the strength of being versatile between operating systems and does not require additional development time to provide support for multiple platforms. The GUI can function similarly across all deployment platforms.

## MediaConchOnline

A web-based user interface (UI) will also be provided for both expert and non-expert users. In order to run this option, an internet access will not be needed or required. Local network access will power the checker within the userâ€™s chosen web-browser. The web interface will provide access to conformance checks without having to directly download and install the software.
