## Release Schedule

This project is expected to release a new development version of all source code each night to be available for download in a single file for each deployment platform. This implies that any user will be able to download and compile an up-to-date version of all source code for deployment platforms relevant for PREFORMA.

There shall always be source code available for download (provided in a single file) for several different deployment platforms (at least for: MS Windows 7, Mac OSX, common Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and Suse). For each platform specific source code version (development version, stable version, and deployed (LTS) version) there shall always be an up-to-date corresponding executable that can be downloaded as a single file. In addition, all old versions (including nightly versions) of source code and corresponding executables shall be available for download over time.

This implies that for each deployment platform (at least for: MS Windows 7, Mac OSX, common Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and Suse) the open source project shall provide a file which contains all necessary open source tools that can be used
(without access to the Internet) to create an executable for that platform. This means that at least six such files (containing open source tools) shall be available for download from the open source project. > For example, a user wishing to create of an executable for MS Windows 7 from the source code provided by the open source project on the open platform will (in principle) undertake the following steps:

	* The complete source code for MS Windows 7 is downloaded as a single file (e.g. “source-mswin7.zip”) from the open source project and extracted on the local machine.
	* The complete build environment for MS Windows 7 is downloaded as a single file (e.g. “buildenvironment-mswin7.zip”) from the open source project and extracted on the local machine.
	* The build enviroment is used on the local machine (which now is not connected to the Internet) to create an executable (e.g. “application-mswin7.exe”) from the extracted source code.

Further, as part of the content of the complete source code for each specific platform, detailed instructions for how to use the build environment to create the executable from the downloaded source code. The instructions must be provided for both technical and non-technical users, and there must be easy to follow detailed step-by-step instructions.

In addition, separate detailed instructions for how to build executables in which source code from different open source projects are integrated into one single executable must also be provided (see further section 2.4)

The source code will contain at minimum:

* Complete source code for MS Windows 7
* Complete source code for Mac OSX
* Complete source code for Ubuntu Linux
* Complete source code for Fedora Linux
* Complete source code for Debian Linux
* Complete source code for Suse Linux

The source code will be fully executible with text, images, and audiovisual files.
